    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:300%;">First Project: Scratch</p>
    <p style="font-size:35px;">This is our scratch game. The goal was to create a game where the goal is to move the avatar to hit the ball to touch the grey button. As you continue the game and score more points, the button will eventually start to move, making the game harder and create different levels. In order to do this, our code has some logic to where the code would read the global score and compare it to a set number. Then using an "If" code, the program would make the button move if the score makes the statement true. We set higher greater than statements to alter the movement of the button to increase difficulty. Using this method, we were able to create "levels" in our game. We also created a score variable to keep record of the amount of times the ball had hit the button. This accumulator is what we referenced to when creating our greater than statements. </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:200%;">Here is the MIT app inventor code for Pong</p>
    <center><img src="MIT app.JPG" width="900" height="600"></center>
    <p style="font-size:35px;">This is Pong. This is an application that we used that is similar to scratch, the previous project we had done, but runs on a different platform and uses different labels. Using MIT App inventor gives us another form of experience when handling with programs. The main objective of pong is the action of bouncing a ball off a paddle for the longest amount of time. We tried to incorperate this in our version of pong by having a bouncing ball and a user controlled paddle. Our version of pong is single player pong between you and the walls of the game. The goal of the game is to score the highest amouunt of points. We designed the code to only allow the user to move the paddle in the x direction by allowing movement strictly in the x axis. Similarly to the scratch game, we needed to keep score. In order to do this, we created a variable, just like what we did in scratch. Using an if block, if the ball touches the paddle then the score will increase by one. This code was much like what we had to do in scratch to achieve this point tallying. </p> 
    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:200%;">Here is what it looks like on the tablet</p>

    <p style="font-size:35px;">Our interface is rather simple. We have a header in order to format the 2 two start and reset buttons. We also have another section that is dedicated to displaying the score that is accumulated in the code. We placed a canvas to add a background to the game so it is not just white.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:300%;">Python: An Interactive fiction</p>
    <iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@ConnorGS/UnfortunateEvents?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
    <p style="font-size:35px;">This is our python interactive fiction game. It is a choose the best path type of story where the goal is to survive the different scenarios. There is only 1 correct path. We used a lot of methods to define different point to call to when creating our code. This allowed us to stay organized and see what and where we were wrtiting our code. Using python was interesting because syntax and indents mattered when writing the code. This is different than MIT app inventor and scratch because we are no longer just using block codes. It was a fun experience using python to create a simple story game that involves a user.</p>

    <p style="font-size:35px;">Using a program called NetLogo, I made changes to a simulation that tracks the movement of an object. What I did was first changing all the shapes from circles to triangles because seeing corners is easier to track in my opinion. Next, I changed the color of the object that is being tracked to blue, and the color of the trail that the object leaves behind from green to orange. I also changed the size of the object so that it is larger and more obvious what is being tracked. Next, I changed the rate at which the simuation accelerated so it is more apparent how the object is being tracked and in doing so, sped up that pattern of movement of the larger object.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:300%;">Python GUI</p>
    <p style="font-size:35px;">This GUI or graphic user interaface was created using a website called repl.it. This is because I was unable to use the the suggested programs such as Canopy to modify the tkinker program. In this program there is a square that says "I hope you are doing well" and then when you click the widget(the button) it now congradulates you for clicking on the button. This is a simple one command GUI that was created.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:300%;"> Data Analysis </p>

    <p style="font-size:35px;">This is the compilation of big data project. In this project, we created a graph that displays a large sum of data. In this, we used plotted the data of the average life expectancy throughout the years. In order to do this, we used matplot to display the data. We created and labeled axes and used 2 lists to store the x and y points to graph. When the data was placed in lists, it was easy to refer to them and be able to plot them in the end.</p>
