    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:300%;">First Project: Scratch</p>
    <p style="font-size:45px;">This is our scratch game. The goal was to create a game where the goal is to move the avatar to hit the ball to touch the grey button. As you continue the game and score more points, the button will eventually start to move, making the game harder and create different levels. In order to do this, our code has some logic to where the code would read the global score and compare it to a set number. Then using an "If" code, the program would make the button move if the score makes the statement true. We set higher greater than statements to alter the movement of the button to increase difficulty. Using this method, we were able to create "levels" in our game. We also created a score variable to keep record of the amount of times the ball had hit the button. This accumulator is what we referenced to when creating our greater than statements. </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:200%;">Here is the MIT app inventor code for Pong</p>

    <p style="font-size:45px;">This is Pong. This is an application that we used that is similar to scratch, the previous project we had done, but runs on a different platform and uses different labels. Using MIT App inventor gives us another form of experience when handling with programs. The main objective of pong is the action of bouncing a ball off a paddle for the longest amount of time. We tried to incorperate this in our version of pong by having a bouncing ball and a user controlled paddle. Our version of pong is single player pong between you and the walls of the game. The goal of the game is to score the highest amouunt of points. We designed the code to only allow the user to move the paddle in the x direction by allowing movement strictly in the x axis. Similarly to the scratch game, we needed to keep score. In order to do this, we created a variable, just like what we did in scratch. Using an if block, if the ball touches the paddle then the score will increase by one. This code was much like what we had to do in scratch to achieve this point tallying. </p> 
    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:200%;">Here is what it looks like on the tablet</p>

    <p style="font-size:45px;">Our interface is rather simple. We have a header in order to format the 2 two start and reset buttons. We also have another section that is dedicated to displaying the score that is accumulated in the code. We placed a canvas to add a background to the game so it is not just white.</p>
