    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:300%;">First Project: Scratch</p>
    <p style="text-size:150%;">This is our scratch game. The goal was to create a game where the goal is to move the avatar to hit the ball to touch the grey button. As you continue the game and score more points, the button will eventually start to move, making the game harder and create different levels. In order to do this, our code has some logic to where the code would read the global score and compare it to a set number. Then using an "If" code, the program would make the button move if the score makes the statement true.</p>

    <p style="text-size:150%;">This is Pong. This is an application that we used that is similar to scratch, the previous project we had done, but runs on a different platform and uses different labels. Using MIT App inventor gives us another form of experience when handling with programs. The main objective of pong is the action of bouncing a ball off a paddle for the longest amount of time. We tried to incorperate this in our version of pong by having a bouncing ball and a user controlled paddle.</p>
